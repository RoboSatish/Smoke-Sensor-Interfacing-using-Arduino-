This makes the MQ2 Gas Sensor Module an excellent choice for building an indoor air quality monitoring system, a breathalyzer, or an early fire detection system.

# MQ2 Gas Sensor
The MQ2 sensor is one of the most widely used in the MQ sensor series. It is a MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor. Metal oxide sensors are also known as Chemiresistors because sensing is based on the change in resistance of the sensing material when exposed to gasses. 
The MQ2 gas sensor operates on 5V DC and consumes approximately 800mW. It can detect LPG, Smoke, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide concentrations ranging from 200 to 10000 ppm.
